GPS sensors have been widely used to track peopleâ€™s everyday life trajectories, generating massive trajectory datasets. The trajectory data typically contains sparse GPS points, and completing trajectories is often necessary. State-of-the-art methods [3, 4] essentially complete the entire route by us- ing a single metric, e.g., either the shortest distance or the fastest driving/walking time. Unfortunately, using a single metric may not always work in real life due to the diversity of mobility patterns. In this demo abstract, we propose a frequent pattern (FP)-based trajectory completion approach, and demonstrate a system prototype to showcase the advan- tages of our approach over four previous works, in terms of accuracy and running time.
